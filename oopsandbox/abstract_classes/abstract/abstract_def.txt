Think about abstract classes as a way for us to structure or create some behavior for certain classes
in here that we know only need to get access from certain classes and not directly by creating objects inside our code.

There are a few rules when it comes to abstract classes such as.....
RULES FOR ABSTRACT CLASSES
1. You can create objects from abstract classes. Which means if I create a class I can't access any of the properties and methods using an object I have to do it through another class.
2. If you create an abstract method inside of a class then, that class Must Be an abstract class.
